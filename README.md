## ðŸ¥“ How to access the meat of this juicy plugin? ðŸ¥“

Using the shortcode `[bacon]` you will be returned with `1` paragraph of Bacon Ipsum.

You can also use `[bacon p=X]` - `X` being the number of paragraphs you want returned.

You can also use `[bacon t="meat-and-filler"]` for meat mixed with miscellaneous â€˜lorem ipsumâ€™ filler instead of only meat.
